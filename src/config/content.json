        "question": "Why not use Shopify or Gumroad?",
        "answer": "Those are great for selling existing products. This is for testing new business ideas. You control everything, pay zero fees, and own your customer data. When your idea takes off, you're not locked into someone else's platform."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of business can I test?",
        "answer": "Any subscription service, digital product, or software tool. Coaching programs, AI tools, productivity apps, B2B services, online courses. If you can charge for it online, you can test it with this. Most successful tests are boring B2B tools, not sexy consumer apps."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I find paying customers?",
        "answer": "Congratulations, you have a business. Keep serving them, listen to their feedback, and grow. This same system handles thousands of customers without breaking. When you need custom features, hire a developer. You'll know exactly what to build because customers told you."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast can I really launch?",
        "answer": "Download today, launch tomorrow. Seriously. The longest part is deciding your price. Most people overthink it for days. Pick a number, launch, and adjust based on real feedback. Motion beats meditation every time."
